# Data Analysis-Portfolio

I am Zahira Fathima Mohammed Chickmagalur, a data analyst with over 2 years of professional experience, backed by an MSc in Business Analytics from the University of Birmingham (Distinction). I leverage tools like Tableau, Power BI, SQL, Python, and Advanced Excel to turn complex data into actionable insights. I specialise in data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, predictive modeling, time-series analysis, and building user-friendly dashboards that empower stakeholders to make informed decisions.

In this portfolio, you’ll find projects showcasing my ability to work with large datasets, develop insightful dashboards, and apply statistical models to solve real-world problems. Some of the highlights include my NHS Data Visualization project, where I developed a dashboard to uncover healthcare trends, and my Diabetes Prediction Analysis, which applied statistical techniques to identify risk factors.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a keen analytical mindset and a collaborative approach to problem-solving. Whether it’s optimizing processes or translating data into meaningful narratives, I am passionate about using data to drive results.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss potential opportunities.
