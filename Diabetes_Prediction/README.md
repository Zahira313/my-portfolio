# Predicting Diabetes Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops predictive models to identify the risk of diabetes based on several factors, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to enable early diagnosis and preventative care.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Jupytr Notebook)
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
- **Additional Tools**: Minitab, SPSS

## Key Highlights
- Performed data preprocessing, including standardization and binning, and EDA.
- visualization of individual factors. 
- Implemented clustering techniques such as DBSCAN for grouping patient data.
- Tested various classification models, with Logistic Regression achieving 98% accuracy.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python [View Jupyter Notebook for Data Preprocessing](./Data-preprocess.ipynb).
   - Applied standardization and discretization techniques [Code](./Data_Discretise_Standardise.ipynb).

2. **Clustering**:
   - Used DBSCAN, achieving a silhouette score of 0.98.

3. **Classification**:
   - Evaluated models like Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.
   - Logistic Regression performed best, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall.
