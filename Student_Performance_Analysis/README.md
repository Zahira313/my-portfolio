# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing students' academic performance using data from Kaggle. It employs regression models and visualizations to uncover insights about students' grades and aspirations for higher education.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Methods**:
  - Multivariate Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Data Visualization

## Key Highlights
- **Data Source**: [High School Alcoholism and Academic Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielluizone/high-school-alcoholism-and-academic-performance/data)
- **Statistical Models**:
  - Regression analysis to identify factors influencing first-semester grades.
  - Logistic regression to predict aspirations for graduate education.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Distribution of grades and parental status.
  - Boxplot of grades.
  - ROC Curve for Logistic Regression Model.

## Results
1. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Gender and internet access positively correlate with academic performance.
   - Age negatively correlates with grades.
2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Predicts the likelihood of aspiring for graduate education with 80% accuracy and an AUC of 0.859.
