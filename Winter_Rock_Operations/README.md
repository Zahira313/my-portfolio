# Winter Rock Operations Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Winter Rock's sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and new product launch strategies** using advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** to optimize operations for the next winter season.

## 📊 Key Topics Covered
1. **Sales Trends Analysis**: 
   - Investigated time-series data to identify seasonal patterns.
   - Used **12-month centered moving average (CMA-12)** for trend smoothing.

2. **Sales Forecasting**:
   - Applied **Single Exponential Smoothing (SES)** for sales prediction.
   - Evaluated error metrics: **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

3. **Distribution Plan Optimization**:
   - Used **Linear Programming (LP)** to minimize distribution costs.
   - Optimized shipments from **Manchester & London distribution centers**.

4. **New Product Demand Planning**:
   - Developed a **Decision Tree Model** to compare supplier options.
   - Conducted **Monte Carlo Simulation** to assess profitability.

## 📈 Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1️⃣ **Sales Trends & Seasonality**
✔ Sales peak in **October - December**, aligning with the winter sports season.  
✔ **CMA-12 analysis** confirms a strong **upward trend** in sales.

### 2️⃣ **Forecasting & Accuracy**
✔ **SES model** predicts stable sales but struggles with seasonality.  
✔ **Optimal alpha value (α = 0.2)** ensures balance between bias and accuracy.

### 3️⃣ **Optimized Distribution Plan**
✔ The **Manchester center ships 2000 units**, **London handles 2200 units**.  
✔ This minimizes **total shipping costs to £99,615**.

### 4️⃣ **New Product Supplier Decision**
✔ **Decision Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation** favor the **USA supplier**.  
✔ Expected profit = **£35,000**, higher than the European supplier.  
✔ Winter Rock should **consider risk mitigation strategies** before finalizing.
